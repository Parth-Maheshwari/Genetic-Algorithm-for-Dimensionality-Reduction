# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Dimensionality-Reduction
Use of Genetic Algorithm for reducing the dimensions of Hyperspectral Dataset using MATLAB 2015b.
This Project was done in the fulfillment of Course GNR602, Advanced Methods in Satellite Image Processing with my colleague Pritish Pawar under the guidance of Prof. Krishna Mohan.

Implemented Genetic Algorithm for selecting 20 bands out of 200+ of Hyperspectral Image in Matlab with a GUI

Achieved 90% Data Reduction with 91% accuracy in SVM Classifier with respect to Original Image
